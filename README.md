# Algoritmos Heurísticos de Otimização

Optimization algorithms are an important area of Artificial Intelligence that are responsible for solving complex problems, based on finding solutions to optimization and search problems. There are several applications of this type of algorithm, which can be applied to solve problems in everyday commercial scenarios. A classic example is solving the teacher schedule clash problem in a school, in which there are several options for schedules and classes and the objective is to build a schedule dynamically according to the number of classes and the availability of each teacher. Other examples are: telecommunications companies can design new optical networks, transport companies can better plan the delivery route of goods, and investors can choose the best investments; among many others.
